# InversionCount
## Motivation
This code was created by me in order to solve the week 2 challenge of "Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms" course offered by Stanford University,
on Coursera.
## Functionality
This is a divide-and-conquer merge-sort-type algorithm that counts the number of inversions in a given set of numbers.
